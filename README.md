# RAI-FEMAI-KneeOA

This GitHub repository includes all Python codes and implementations to train, validate, and test a multi-modal AI framework that combines MRI data with patient-specific metadata (e.g., sex, race) to enhance the accuracy and fairness of knee OA diagnosis.

### Project timeline
The following is a tentative timeline for carrying out this research in Fall 2024 (September 10 - December 15, 2024).  
- Weeks 1-3: Understanding and working with NIH-OAI dataset plus review state-of-the-art AI methods in knee OA diagnosis
   - Review state-of-the-art AI methods in knee OA diagnosis
   - Computationally assemble a retrospective imaging dataset combined with metadata using publicly available NIH-OIA dataset
- Weeks 4-7: AI model(s) development 
   - Building, training, and validating fair, explainable, and multi-modal AI/deep learning models for Knee OA prediction and diagnosis.
- Weeks 7-8: AI Model(s) Validation
   - AI models validation through computational methods combined with keeping clinicians/surgeons in the loop
- Weeks 8-9: GitHub Repository
	 - Create a GitHub repository to make all supplementary materials and codes publicly and freely available to promote open scientific research.
- Weeks 10: Fall break (Thanksgiving)
- Weeks 11: GitHub Repository
   -	Create a GitHub repository to make all supplementary materials and codes publicly and freely available to promote open scientific research.
- Weeks 12-13: Wrap-up and research dissemination
   - Finalize project report
   - Prepare and deliver a 10-minute presentation
   - Research dissemination will be started (e.g., abstract/manuscript preparation, tutorials)
